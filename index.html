<h1>Tag X - How the Game Works</h3>
<p>
    The aim of Tag X is to score more points than the opposing team by full time. Points are earned by scoring tries, which happens when a player places the ball on or over the try line.
</p>

<h1>The rulebook</h1>

<h2>Number of Players</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>A standard game features <strong>seven players per team</strong>, although some formats may use different numbers.</li>
  </ul>

<h2>Passing</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Players may pass the ball <strong>backwards</strong> or <strong>sideways</strong>, but <strong>not forwards</strong>.</li>
  </ul>

</div>
  <h2>Scoring</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>A try is worth <strong>1 point</strong>.</li>
    <li>In mixed gender games, a try scored by a female player is worth <strong>2 points</strong>.</li>
    <li>There are <strong>no conversions</strong> in Tag Rugby.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Tagging and Restarting Play</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Defenders stop the ball carrier by removing their tag.</li>
    <li>The defender raises the tag, then drops it at the spot where the tag occurred.</li>
    <li>The tagged player returns to the mark, places the ball on the ground, and rolls it backward with their foot—this is called a <strong>roll ball</strong> or <strong>play the ball</strong>.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Defensive Positioning</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>One defender (the <strong>marker</strong>) may stand directly in front of the attacker, within one metre, during the roll ball.</li>
    <li>The rest of the defenders must be <strong>7 metres back</strong> and in line with the referee.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Dummy Half Rules</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>The <strong>dummy half</strong> is the player who picks up the ball after the roll ball and distributes it.</li>
    <li>They may pick up and run or pass the ball while wearing one or no tags, but may only take <strong>one step</strong> before passing if they have fewer than two tags.</li>
    <li>The dummy half <strong>can be tagged</strong> and <strong>can score a try</strong>.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Time Limit at the Roll Ball</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>If the dummy half delays picking up the ball, the referee may start a <strong>three-second countdown</strong>.</li>
    <li>If the ball isn’t picked up in time, possession changes to the defending team at the same location.</li>
    <li>The <strong>marker</strong> must stay square and stationary until the dummy half touches the ball.</li>
    <li>Any interference by the marker results in a <strong>penalty to the attacking team</strong>.</li>
    <li>The referee may begin the 3-second count earlier if the roll ball is unnecessarily delayed.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Possession and Turnovers</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Each team has <strong>six plays</strong> (or tags) to advance the ball before possession changes.</li>
    <li>If a player is tagged while wearing <strong>one or no tags</strong>, they must stop and perform a roll ball.</li>
    <li><strong>Surrendering</strong> (voluntarily stopping for a tag) is not allowed and results in a penalty.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Contact and Safety</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Tag X is a <strong>minimal-contact sport</strong>.</li>
    <li>Attackers must avoid defenders and cannot initiate contact.</li>
    <li>Defenders may not step into the path of attackers.</li>
    <li>Whoever initiates contact will be <strong>penalised</strong>.</li>
    <li>Ball carriers may not protect their tags using hands, elbows, or the ball.</li>
    <li>Deliberate fending or blocking of a defender’s hand is not allowed.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Ball Handling</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>If the attacker is tagged at the same time they release the ball, play continues (advantage to the attacker).</li>
    <li>If a player trips or falls to their knees:
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Play on</strong> if no defender is within tagging distance.</li>
        <li><strong>Deemed tagged</strong> if a defender is within tagging distance.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>A defender cannot dive on or pick up a loose ball from a knock-on or knock-back.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Kicking Rules</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Kicks are allowed as long as the ball stays <strong>below the referee’s shoulder height</strong> before bouncing.</li>
    <li><strong>No drop kicks</strong> are allowed.</li>
    <li>Players must not <strong>dive, slip, or fall</strong> on a kicked ball.</li>
    <li>A player may kick a loose ball only if:
      <ul>
        <li>No opponent is reaching for it with their hands.</li>
        <li>The kick stays below shoulder height before bouncing.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
