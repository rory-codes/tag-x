<!--Rules section-->
<section id="tag-x-rules"  class="hidden">
<h2>Tag X - How the Game Works</h2>
<p>
    The aim of Tag X is to score more points than the opposing team by full time. Points are earned by scoring tries, which happens when a player places the ball on or over the try line.
</p>
<p>
    The game is played on a rectangular playing area (roughly half of a rugby pitch) with two teams of six or seven players each. Players wear tags attached to their shorts, which defenders must remove to stop the ball carrier. The game emphasizes speed, agility, and teamwork, making it suitable for players of all ages and skill levels.
</p>
<h2>The TAG X Rulebook</h2>

<h3>Number of Players</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>A standard game features <strong>seven players per team</strong>, although some formats may use different numbers.</li>
  </ul>

<h3>Passing</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Players may pass the ball <strong>backwards</strong> or <strong>sideways</strong>, but <strong>not forwards</strong>.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Scoring</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>A try is worth <strong>1 point</strong>.</li>
    <li>In mixed gender games, a try scored by a female player is worth <strong>2 points</strong>.</li>
    <li>There are <strong>no conversions</strong> in Tag Rugby.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Tagging and Restarting Play</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Defenders stop the ball carrier by removing their tag.</li>
    <li>The defender raises the tag, then drops it at the spot where the tag occurred.</li>
    <li>The tagged player returns to the mark, places the ball on the ground, and rolls it backward with their foot—this is called a <strong>roll ball</strong> or <strong>play the ball</strong>.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Defensive Positioning</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>One defender (the <strong>marker</strong>) may stand directly in front of the attacker, within one metre, during the roll ball.</li>
    <li>The rest of the defenders must be <strong>7 metres back</strong> and in line with the referee.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Dummy Half Rules</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>The <strong>dummy half</strong> is the player who picks up the ball after the roll ball and distributes it.</li>
    <li>They may pick up and run or pass the ball while wearing one or no tags, but may only take <strong>one step</strong> before passing if they have fewer than two tags.</li>
    <li>The dummy half <strong>can be tagged</strong> and <strong>can score a try</strong>.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Time Limit at the Roll Ball</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>If the dummy half delays picking up the ball, the referee may start a <strong>three-second countdown</strong>.</li>
    <li>If the ball isn't picked up in time, possession changes to the defending team at the same location.</li>
    <li>The <strong>marker</strong> must stay square and stationary until the dummy half touches the ball.</li>
    <li>Any interference by the marker results in a <strong>penalty to the attacking team</strong>.</li>
    <li>The referee may begin the 3-second count earlier if the roll ball is unnecessarily delayed.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Possession and Turnovers</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Each team has <strong>six plays</strong> (or tags) to advance the ball before possession changes.</li>
    <li>If a player is tagged while wearing <strong>one or no tags</strong>, they must stop and perform a roll ball.</li>
    <li><strong>Surrendering</strong> (voluntarily stopping for a tag) is not allowed and results in a penalty.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Contact and Safety</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Tag X is a <strong>minimal-contact sport</strong>.</li>
    <li>Attackers must avoid defenders and cannot initiate contact.</li>
    <li>Defenders may not step into the path of attackers.</li>
    <li>Whoever initiates contact will be <strong>penalised</strong>.</li>
    <li>Ball carriers may not protect their tags using hands, elbows, or the ball.</li>
    <li>Deliberate fending or blocking of a defender’s hand is not allowed.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Ball Handling</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>If the attacker is tagged at the same time they release the ball, play continues (advantage to the attacker).</li>
    <li>If a player trips or falls to their knees:
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Play on</strong> if no defender is within tagging distance.</li>
        <li><strong>Deemed tagged</strong> if a defender is within tagging distance.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>A defender cannot dive on or pick up a loose ball from a knock-on or knock-back.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Kicking Rules</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Kicks are allowed as long as the ball stays <strong>below the referee's shoulder height</strong> before bouncing.</li>
    <li><strong>No drop kicks</strong> are allowed.</li>
    <li>Players must not <strong>dive, slip, or fall</strong> on a kicked ball.</li>
    <li>A player may kick a loose ball only if:
      <ul>
        <li>No opponent is reaching for it with their hands.</li>
        <li>The kick stays below shoulder height before bouncing.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>

<section id="history"  class="hidden">
<h2>History of Tag Rugby</h2>
  <div>
  <p>Tag Rugby originated in the late 20th century as a safer, non-contact variation of traditional rugby. Initially designed as a training activity, it became popular for use in small spaces and on hard surfaces. While the precise origin is debated, it's widely believed that the sport began in Gibraltar due to the absence of grass pitches, before being formalized in England by Nick Leonard as a structured sport for school children.</p>
<div id="history-content">
  <h3>Timeline of Development</h3>
  <ul id="history-dropdown">
    <li><strong>Late 1970s - Early 1980s:</strong> The Gibraltar Rugby Union adapted a form of rugby suitable for hard ground with limited space.</li>
    <li><strong>1983:</strong> Sportswriter Terry Godwin noted that tag rugby was already played in Gibraltar by navy personnel and locals.</li>
    <li><strong>1990:</strong> Nick Leonard, a PE teacher in England, established official rules, likely influenced by naval games seen in Gibraltar.</li>
    <li><strong>1991:</strong> Leonard hosted the first school tag rugby festival in Plymouth, UK.</li>
    <li><strong>1992:</strong> In Australia, Perry Haddock launched "Oztag" while coaching a St George under-20 team.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Growth and International Spread</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Tag Rugby gained massive popularity in Australia, reaching over 200,000 participants.</li>
    <li>The sport later expanded to New Zealand and Ireland.</li>
    <li><strong>2009:</strong> Three Australians, including Alistair Davis, founded <strong>Try Tag Rugby</strong> in London, starting regular league competitions.</li>
    <li>Try Tag Rugby has since expanded throughout England and Scotland, developing local franchises and national reach.</li>
  </ul>
<h3>Tag X</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Established in 2025. Tag X looks to continue what other organisations are already doing and add the growth and popularity of the sport.</li>
